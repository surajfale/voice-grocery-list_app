# Migration from JSONBin to MongoDB Backend

## What Changed

We've migrated from JSONBin cloud storage to a proper MongoDB backend for better reliability and performance.

## For Existing Users

If you had an account with the previous JSONBin version:
- You'll need to create a new account as user data was not migrated
- Your grocery lists from the old system are not accessible in the new system
- This ensures better data security and reliability going forward

## Benefits of the New System

- ✅ Reliable user authentication that persists across server restarts
- ✅ Faster data loading and saving
- ✅ Better error handling and recovery
- ✅ More scalable architecture
- ✅ Full control over your data

## Cleanup

If you were testing the app during development, you can clean up old localStorage data:

```javascript
// Run this in browser console to clean up old data (optional)
localStorage.removeItem('voiceGrocery_configBinId');
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.includes('voiceGrocery_') && key !== 'groceryListUser') {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});
```

Note: This will only remove old configuration data. Your current user session will remain intact.
